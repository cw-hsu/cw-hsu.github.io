### my journey

Born and raised in Taiwan then up and down the California coast. Have a degree in Energy Technology and Policy from what's now called Cal Poly Humboldt. Professionally a researcher, 
GIS analyst, project manager. Unprofessionally an urban explorer, fixated on the lack of human-centric design and dreaming of solutions.
